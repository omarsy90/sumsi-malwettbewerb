    <h1>Participation Conditions for the Sumsi Drawing Competition</h1>
<div class="teilnahmebedingungen">  
    <p>Every parent who submits a drawing of their child (who has not yet completed the 14th year of life) via the present contact form from October 19 to November 5, 2021, has a chance to win the main prize and other great prizes. All submitted drawings will be published in the large Sumsi Gallery at www.raiffeisen-sumsi.at.
    From all submitted drawings, 10 drawings will be selected. These 10 winners can look forward to great prizes.</p>
  <p> By participating in the Sumsi Drawing Competition, the participants agree to the following terms and conditions: </p> 
    <ul>
        <li>All natural persons are eligible to participate.</li>
        <li>Participation in the drawing competition is free, voluntary, and independent of banking transactions. The winners are determined by random draw. Legal recourse is excluded. Prizes cannot be redeemed in cash, transferred, or exchanged.</li>
        <li>Participation through sweepstakes clubs or automated services is not permitted. Only one participation per person is possible. The participant may accept the prizes within 4 weeks after electronic notification in case of winning; thereafter, this claim expires and the prize is forfeited.</li>
        <li>The organizer assumes no liability for any technical difficulties.</li>
        <li>The participant declares that their submission to the drawing competition (the drawing) does not infringe the rights of third parties, in particular copyrights and personal rights. He/she expressly agrees to the publication of the drawing as part of the drawing competition or on the homepage of the organizer.</li>
        <li>If other persons were involved in the creation of the drawing or if third parties were granted exclusive rights to the submitted contribution, they must agree to the submission and subsequent publication within the framework of the drawing competition.</li>
        <li>The organizer reserves the right to request written proof from participants of meeting the above requirements on certain occasions. If the proof is not provided when requested, the participant may be excluded from participation by the organizer.</li>
        <li>The organizer reserves the right to exclude participants who violate the participation conditions, criminal laws or other regulations, or common decency, or attempt to influence the drawing competition in any way through technical manipulation. In the event of exclusion from the competition, the organizer is free to subsequently deny and reclaim the prizes.</li>
        <li>The organizer reserves the right to end or interrupt the drawing competition or the raffle at any time for important reasons without prior notice. This applies in particular if the orderly process of the drawing competition or the raffle would be disrupted or prevented. The participant has no rights arising from this.</li>
